- 👋 Hi, I’m Lenny Erwine
- 👀 I’m interested in making computers more useful through software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning good ways to use the new features of c# versions 9 and 10.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing ways to rebuff the latest "citizen developer" trend.
  - After all, if we have a system were any untrained dummy can create an app, then that's exactly who will be coming up with the designs. I'd much rather be making things better than fixing someone else's mistakes.
- 📫 (My google site is currently being converted. Contact form coming soon)
